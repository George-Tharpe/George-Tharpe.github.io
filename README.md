## About Me
![About Me Photo](https://i.imgur.com/5rPPSe7.jpeg)

This is a short description about me intended to be read by a potential employer.
```
My name is George Tharpe, I am a 20 year old undergraduate student at UGA. My major is Computer Systems Engineering, 
which is a small major at the University of Georgia's College of Engineering. The major is essentially
half electrical engineering and half computer science; to learn more about my major check out 
https://engineering.uga.edu/bs-computer-systems-engineering . I grew up in Snellville Georgia with my mom, brother,
and dog. My brother, Henry, is 22 and in law school at Emory Law. Henry is the hardest working person I know, and I 
have learned a lot from him. My mom is a middle school math teacher who always pushed me to do well in school. 
Constantly dealing with students not doing homework in her classes, my mom made it a point that I completed every 
assignment. She pushed me to do well in every class, but math and science was clearly what I was ment to do. 
Math based sciences were always my favorite classes because I understood them and they were interesting. I was 
first introduced to coding in AP Computer Science, which I took my senior year of high school. My teacher was 
really cool and would always stay after class to talk to me about math and science concepts. AP ComSci. was the
first time that I worked on problems that weren’t assigned; I did them purely for fun! 

While I do find coding interesting enough to do for fun, I spend most of my free time on my skateboard. 
Every since I started skateboarding at the start of 2020, it has quickly become an obsession for me.
Over quarantine it was the only thing I had to do, and I picked it up really quickly. In case you were
curious, I can do kick flips, jump down stairs, and ride on rails. I am not exaggerating when I say 
skateboarding changed my life. I have met dozens of friends, improved my health, and learned new ways of 
thinking. More specifically, skateboarding taught me confidence, creativity, and the perseverance to keep
trying even when you fail. In a way learning a new trick is similar to working on code. They’re both about 
trial and error.
