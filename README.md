## About Me
![About Me Photo](https://i.imgur.com/5rPPSe7.jpeg)

This is a short description about me intended to be read by a potential employer.
```
My name is George Tharpe, I am a 20 year old undergraduate student at UGA. My major is Computer Systems Engineering, which is a small major at the University of Georgia's College of Engineering. The major is essentially half electrical engineering and half computer science; to learn more about my major check out https://engineering.uga.edu/bs-computer-systems-engineering . I grew up in Snellville Georgia with my mom, brother, and dog. My brother, Henry, is 22 and in law school at Emory Law. Henry is the hardest working person I know, and I have learned a lot from him. My mom is a middle school math teacher who always pushed me to do well in school. Constantly dealing with students not doing homework in her classes, my mom made it a point that I completed every assignment. She pushed me to do well in every class, but math and science was clearly what I was ment to do. Math based sciences were always my favorite classes because I understood them and they were interesting.
